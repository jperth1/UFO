## How to Use Webpage to Fetch UFO Data

Use the input fields provided under “Filter Search” on the left-hand side of the page to filter the table and retrieve refined UFO data. Replicate the format provided in the input field when inputting the search criteria. The table can be filtered with the following criteria: Date, City, State, County, and Shape. For example, all the UFO sightings in California can be filtered by typing “ca” within the “Enter State” input field and pressing enter. This will immediately cause the table to filter the data and display only UFO sightings in California.

Similarly, the table can be filtered by date. For example, all UFO sightings on January 12,2010 can be filtered by typing “1/12/2010” into the “Enter Date” input field and pressing enter. This will filter the table to show only UFO sightings on 1/12/2010.

These two filters can by combined to fetch UFO sightings in California on 1/12/2010. Repeat the same actions as before: type “1/12/2010” into the “Enter Date” field and “ca” within the “Enter State” input field and pressing enter. This will filter the table to show only UFO sightings on 1/12/2010 in California.

## Summary

One of the drawbacks of this webpage is that there is limited data. The data only includes sights from the United States, and only from the month of January in 2010. The webpage should include more UFO sighting data from other countries and dates.

It is recommended that the webpage provides users the opportunity to enter in UFO sighting data. More data is always beneficial when it comes to future analysis, identifying trends and showcasing patterns. Additionally, it is recommended that users also have the opportunity to attach videos or pictures of their UFO sightings in addition to the data fields required. This would expand data collection and allow other users to explore images and compare sights.

Finally, it is recommended to include a “Filter” button under the “Filter Search” section. Many people do not know that pressing enter can execute the filter action. Providing a button for this action is user-friendly, inclusive, and adheres to ADA requirements for visual impairments.
